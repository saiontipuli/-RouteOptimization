# -RouteOptimization
We start by collecting real-world data from smart dustbins equipped with ultrasonic sensors and ESP32 modules, which wirelessly transmit the data to Google Sheets for dynamic storage. By focusing on high waste-generating areas in Guntur, we leverage the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to generate the most efficient routes for waste collection.
